# clojure.core

> _Namespace:_ `clojure.core`

The core Clojure standard library. Provides the fundamental building blocks
  of the language: collection operations, sequence processing, arithmetic,

#### `dotimes`

```clojure
(dotimes bindings & body)
```

bindings =&gt; name n
  Repeatedly executes body (presumably for side-effects) with name
  bound to integers from 0 through n-1.

---

#### `for`

```clojure
(for seq-exprs & body)
```

List comprehension. Takes a vector of one or more
  binding-form/collection-expr pairs, each followed by zero or more
  modifiers, and yields a sequence of evaluations of expr.
  Supported modifiers: :let, :when, :while.

---

#### `if-let`

```clojure
(if-let bindings then)
(if-let bindings then else)
```

bindings =&gt; binding-form test
  If test is true, evaluates then with binding-form bound to the value of test, otherwise evaluates else.

---

#### `if-some`

```clojure
(if-some bindings then)
(if-some bindings then else)
```

bindings =&gt; binding-form test
  If test is not nil, evaluates then with binding-form bound to the
  value of test, if not, yields else

---

#### `let`

```clojure
(let bindings & body)
```

binding =&gt; binding-form init-expr
  Evaluates the exprs in a lexical context in which the symbols in the binding-forms are bound to their respective init-exprs values. Supports destructuring.

---

#### `letfn`

```clojure
(letfn fnspecs & body)
```

fnspecs =&gt; (fname [params*] exprs)+
  Takes a vector of function specs and a body. Binds each fname to its fn in a shared environment so all functions can mutually reference each other.

---

#### `loop`

```clojure
(loop bindings & body)
```

Evaluates the exprs in a lexical context in which the symbols in the binding-forms are bound to their respective init-exprs values, then evaluates body. recur rebinds the bindings to the supplied values and re-evaluates body.

---

#### `or`

```clojure
(or & forms)
```

Evaluates exprs one at a time, from left to right. If a form returns a logical true value, returns that value without evaluating the rest. Otherwise returns the value of the last expr. (or) returns nil.

---

#### `when`

```clojure
(when condition & body)
```

Executes body when condition is true, otherwise returns nil.

---

#### `when-first`

```clojure
(when-first bindings & body)
```

bindings =&gt; x xs
  Roughly the same as (when (seq xs) (let [x (first xs)] body)) but xs is evaluated only once

---

#### `when-let`

```clojure
(when-let bindings & body)
```

bindings =&gt; binding-form test
  When test is true, evaluates body with binding-form bound to the value of test.

---

#### `when-not`

```clojure
(when-not condition & body)
```

Executes body when condition is false, otherwise returns nil.

---

#### `when-some`

```clojure
(when-some bindings & body)
```

bindings =&gt; binding-form test
  When test is not nil, evaluates body with binding-form bound to the
  value of test

---

#### `while`

```clojure
(while test & body)
```

Repeatedly executes body while test expression is true. Presumes
  some side-effect will cause test to become false/nil.

---

#### `with-redefs`

```clojure
(with-redefs bindings & body)
```

binding =&gt; var-symbol temp-value-expr
  Temporarily redefines Vars while executing the body. The
  temp-value-exprs will be evaluated and each resulting value will
  replace in parallel the root value of its Var. Always restores
  the original values, even if body throws.

---

### Functions

#### `defn`

```clojure
(defn name & fdecl)
```

Same as (def name (fn [params*] exprs*)). Optionally accepts a docstring and attribute-map before params. Attaches :doc and :arglists metadata to the var.

---

#### `fn`

```clojure
(fn & sigs)
```

params =&gt; positional-params*, or positional-params* & rest-param
  Defines an anonymous function. Supports destructuring, multiple arities, and an optional name for self-recursion.

---

### IO

#### `with-err-str`

```clojure
(with-err-str & body)
```

Like with-out-str but captures *err* output (warn, etc.).

---

#### `with-out-str`

```clojure
(with-out-str & body)
```

Evaluates body in a context in which *out* is bound to a fresh string
  accumulator. Returns the string of all output produced by println, print,
  pr, prn, pprint and newline during the evaluation.

---

### Introspection

#### `doc`

```clojure
(doc sym)
```

---

### Lazy

#### `delay`

```clojure
(delay & body)
```

Takes a body of expressions and yields a Delay object that will invoke the body only the first time it is forced (via force or deref/@), and will cache the result and return it on all subsequent force calls.

---

### Multimethods

#### `defmethod`

```clojure
(defmethod mm-name dispatch-val & fn-tail)
```

Creates and installs a new method for multimethod mm-name with dispatch value dispatch-val.

---

#### `defmulti`

```clojure
(defmulti name dispatch-fn & opts)
```

Creates a new multimethod with the given name and dispatch function. Re-evaluating a defmulti preserves all previously registered methods.

---

### Protocols

#### `defprotocol`

```clojure
(defprotocol name & specs)
```

Defines a named protocol. Creates a protocol var and one dispatch
  function var per method in the current namespace.

  (defprotocol IShape
    "doc"
    (area [this] "Compute area.")
    (perimeter [this] "Compute perimeter."))

---

#### `extend-protocol`

```clojure
(extend-protocol proto-sym & specs)
```

  (extend-protocol IShape
    nil
    (area [_] 0)
    String
    (area [s] (count s)))

---

#### `extend-type`

```clojure
(extend-type type-sym & specs)
```

Extends a type to implement one or more protocols.

  (extend-type Circle
    IShape
    (area [this] ...)
    ISerializable
    (to-json [this] ...))

---

### Records

#### `defrecord`

```clojure
(defrecord type-name fields & specs)
```

Defines a record type: a named, typed persistent map.
  Creates -&gt;Name (positional) and map-&gt;Name (map-based) constructors.
  Optionally implements protocols inline.

  (defrecord Circle [radius]
    IShape
    (area [this] (* js/Math.PI radius radius)))

---

### Threading

#### `->`

```clojure
(-> x & forms)
```

Threads the expr through the forms. Inserts x as the second item in the first form, making a list of it if it is not a list already. If there are more forms, inserts the first form as the second item in second form, etc.

---

#### `->>`

```clojure
(->> x & forms)
```

Threads the expr through the forms. Inserts x as the last item in the first form, making a list of it if it is not a list already. If there are more forms, inserts the first form as the last item in second form, etc.

---

#### `as->`

```clojure
(as-> expr name & forms)
```

Binds name to expr, evaluates the first form in the lexical context of that binding, then binds name to that result, repeating for each successive form. Returns the result of the last form.

---

#### `cond->`

```clojure
(cond-> expr & clauses)
```

Takes an expression and a set of test/form pairs. Threads expr through each form (via -&gt;) whose corresponding test returns logical true.

---

#### `cond->>`

```clojure
(cond->> expr & clauses)
```

Takes an expression and a set of test/form pairs. Threads expr through each form (via -&gt;&gt;) whose corresponding test returns logical true.

---

#### `some->`

```clojure
(some-> expr & forms)
```

When expr is not nil, threads it into the first form (via -&gt;), and when that result is not nil, through the next etc.

---

#### `some->>`

```clojure
(some->> expr & forms)
```

When expr is not nil, threads it into the first form (via -&gt;&gt;), and when that result is not nil, through the next etc.

---

### General

#### `comment`

```clojure
(comment & _body)

Ignores body, yields nil

---

#### `declare`

```clojure
(declare sym)
```

defs the supplied var names with no bindings, useful for making forward declarations.

---

#### `defn-`

```clojure
(defn- name & fdecl)
